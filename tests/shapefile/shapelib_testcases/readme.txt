The shapefiles in this directory are a test suite used by shapelib.
They don't cover every case, but seemed a good starting point.
Shapelib can be found at http://shapelib.maptools.org/

The test cases are generated by shptest.c, CVS version 1.7, which
is part of shapelib and can be downloaded from the above url.
Since we're embedding the test cases themselves here in this
directory, we note that they are Copyright 1999 Frank Warmerdam,
