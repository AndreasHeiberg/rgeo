{"name":"Rgeo","body":"## RGeo\r\n\r\nRGeo is a geospatial data library for Ruby.\r\n\r\nRGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the Ruby programming language. At its core is an implementation of the industry standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data\r\nrepresentations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons, along with a set of geometric analysis operations. This makes it ideal for modeling geolocation data. It also supports a suite of optional add-on modules that provide various geolocation-related services.\r\n\r\nUse the core **rgeo** gem to:\r\n\r\n* Represent spatial and geolocation data objects such as points, lines, and polygons in your Ruby application.\r\n* Perform standard spatial analysis operations such as finding intersections, creating buffers, and computing lengths and areas.\r\n* Correctly handle spherical geometry, and compute geographic projections for map display and data analysis.\r\n* Read and write location data in the WKT and WKB representations used by spatial databases.\r\n\r\nRGeo forms the core of a suite of tools, including:\r\n\r\n* Generate and interpret GeoJSON data for communication with common location-based web services using the **rgeo-geojson** gem.\r\n* Read GIS datasets from ESRI shapefiles using the **rgeo-shapefile** gem.\r\n* Extend ActiveRecord to support spatial databases using RGeo's spatial ActiveRecord adapters. These are available via the gems:\r\n  * **activerecord-postgis-adapter** for PostGIS\r\n  * **activerecord-spatialite-adapter** for Spatialite\r\n  * **activerecord-mysql2spatial-adapter** for MySQL Spatial\r\n* and more to come...\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\n* See the [documentation](http://dazuma.github.com/rgeo/rdoc)\r\n* Source code on [Github](http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo)\r\n* Join the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rgeo-users)\r\n","tagline":"Geospatial data library for Ruby","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
